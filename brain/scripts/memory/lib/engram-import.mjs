// engram-import.mjs — brain record → engram observation (the import half of
// the C0 loss contract, REQ-C2B1-1, issue #221 C2b-1).
//
// Pure: no filesystem, no engram dependency, no child processes (mirrors
// engram-export.mjs's contract). Designed as the INVERSE of exportObservation():
// undoes the R2 title fold, renders provenance back into §4 prose via the
// shared renderProvenance(), and maps `ts` back to engram's naive timestamp
// form. Acceptance is the id-equality round-trip (design.md Decision 2,
// sdd/memory-format/c4-roundtrip-equality): exportObservation(importRecord(r))
// must reproduce computeRecordId(r) — NOT byte equality.
//
// CORRECTED (issue #404 — this header previously read "the source/issue render
// asymmetry is inert, since `source` is excluded from the hash"). That was true
// of `source` and false of `issue`, and the two are not independent: the engram
// observation shape has NO field for either and no free-form metadata slot to
// hold one (ADR-0017's 2026-07 finding; re-checked against engram v1.20.0's
// `observations` schema on 2026-08-05), so BOTH travel inside ONE
// `**Fuente:**` line in `content`. `source` losing bytes there is indeed inert.
// `issue` being DROPPED there is not: `issue` IS in the hashInput
// (format.mjs#computeRecordId), so the round-tripped record hashed to a
// different id. renderFuente() (provenance.mjs) now emits a line that parses
// back to the record's own `issue` for every record whose `issue` is a number;
// `source` may widen or narrow, and that part stays inert.

// The R2 fold buildRecord() applies: `"**" + title + "**\n\n" + content`.
// Reversible when content matches this shape — whatever title/body split is
// extracted, re-concatenating them with the same fixed template reproduces
// the original bytes exactly, which is all id-equality requires (byte-exact
// semantic title recovery is not). Content with no leading title block is
// returned unchanged, mirroring buildRecord's falsy-title no-op.
